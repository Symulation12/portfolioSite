            In essence, the purpose of this program is to identify patterns in a data stream of strings containing a mixture of hexidecimal and character values. When a pattern is identified, the program responds by performing various actions which could include saying something via TTS, playing a specified sound file, or adding data to the data stream. This project gets it's current name from friends of mine who helped me test the program. The program is designed to be very modular: Adding a pattern to recognize is as simple as copying a template function, setting a regular expression, then adding your response.
